      <p>
        We are three UVA students looking to make a change in Charlottesville. 
        We noticed that many restaurants and dining halls have copious amounts of food waste and we wanted to address this.
        Our main goal is make a difference in the sustainibilty climate and find a way to contect these leftover vendors with Homeless shelters.
